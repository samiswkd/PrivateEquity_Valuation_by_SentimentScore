# PrivateEquity_Valuation_by_SentimentScore  

## Overview

This is my second Project from Y-FoRM. It was conducted as part of the Y-FoRM 24-2 long-term project initiative.

This project's objective was to valuate private companies, which are not yet public offered but are going to, through using Sentiment Analysis and Multiple Regression Analysis.
